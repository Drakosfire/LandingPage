/**
 * CSS Layer Order Declaration
 * 
 * CRITICAL: This file must be imported FIRST before any other CSS.
 * CSS @layer order is determined by first declaration, so this file
 * establishes the cascade priority before any content is added.
 * 
 * Layer Priority (lowest to highest):
 * 1. canvas-reset     - Browser normalization (lowest)
 * 2. canvas-structure - Column widths, flexbox, page dimensions (Canvas owns)
 * 3. theme            - Colors, fonts, backgrounds (Themes own - e.g., D&D PHB)
 * 4. canvas-overrides - Structural overrides that MUST win over theme
 * 5. component-overrides - Component-specific adjustments
 * 6. print            - Print/PDF export styles (highest)
