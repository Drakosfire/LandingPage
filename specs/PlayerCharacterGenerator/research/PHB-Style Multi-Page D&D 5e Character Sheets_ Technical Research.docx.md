# PHB-Style Multi-Page D\&D 5e Character Sheets: Technical Research

## Homebrewery PHB CSS Class Reference

**.brewRenderer & .pages:** High-level wrapper DIVs for the rendered content. In Homebrewery’s structure, .brewRenderer contains the entire brew HTML, and a .pages container holds one or more .page elements (each .page corresponds to one printed page). These wrappers mostly serve as containers; styling is applied at the page level.

**.page.phb:** Represents a single page styled in the 5e Player’s Handbook theme. A .page.phb element is sized to standard US Letter dimensions (width \~215.9mm, height \~279.4mm) with **two-column layout** by default. The PHB stylesheet applies a parchment-like **background image** to each page and sets inner **padding** (approx. 1.4 cm top, 1.9 cm sides, 1.7 cm bottom) to act as page margins. For example, the CSS defines: *height: 279.4mm; width: 215.9mm;* with column-count: 2 and column-gap: 0.9cm for a two-column flow. Each page uses overflow: hidden and has page-break-before: always; page-break-after: always; so that it will always start on a new page in print/PDF output. The page’s base font is a serif (called **BookSanity** in the Homebrewery CSS) at \~13px size, with text color defaulting to black on the parchment background[\[1\]](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L0WUSjJyFHG7PDyIFta#:~:text=...%20spellList%7B%20font,fill%3Aauto).

**.columnWrapper:** Inside each page, content is wrapped in a .columnWrapper div. This element inherits the page’s column settings so that text flows in multiple columns. Notably, Homebrewery sets .columnWrapper { column-span: all; columns: inherit; column-gap: inherit; max-height: 100%; }. This means the wrapper itself spans the full column span and uses the same column count/gap as the page. All brew content (text, images, frames) is placed inside this wrapper. By default, content will automatically flow from the left column into the right column on each page. The PHB CSS uses balanced column fill (so text distributes evenly) unless overridden. (Homebrewery’s code inserts explicit \\column break markers in the source to fine-tune column breaks[\[2\]](https://github.com/bmack08/Mythforge/blob/a95d4cdb805f7fe16009cbb356d731b0625729d5/client/homebrew/brewRenderer/brewRenderer.jsx#L24-L31), since CSS column-fill is balanced by default.)

**.wide:** A utility class indicating an element should span across both columns. In the PHB stylesheet, any block with class .wide will not be confined to a single column. Technically, this is achieved by column-span: all on that element. For example, Homebrewery headings are often wide – e.g. .phb h1 is styled with column-span: all so that titles go across the page[\[3\]](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L0WUSjJyFHG7PDyIFta/-L71An5UlOm6NaHGBsZZ/source#:~:text=GM%20Binder%20Styling%20Reference%20,H3%20%60%60%60). A block element (like a div or table) with class wide will break the column flow and occupy the full page width. In our context, this is useful for elements like a character name header or a full-width table. *(Example: the Monster statblock in Homebrewery is a .block.monster.frame.wide, making it span the page width.)*

**.block:** A generic class for content blocks. Homebrewery uses \<div class="block ..."\> to denote a self-contained block element in the brew. By itself, .block may provide default spacing (e.g. margins between blocks), though most styling comes from additional classes. For instance, a **note box** or a **stat block** will be \<div class="block note ..."\> or \<div class="block monster ..."\>. In the character sheet, each major section (abilities, skills, features, etc.) can be wrapped in a .block to separate it from others. The PHB CSS typically ensures that each .block starts on a new column if it doesn’t fit, or adds spacing between .block elements (this is part of the default behavior of multi-column layout and any margins defined in the theme).

**.frame:** A class that, when added to a .block, gives it the styled **“framed”** appearance – a parchment-colored inset with a border. The .frame class is used extensively for bordered panels (like stat blocks, text boxes, etc.). In the PHB theme, framed blocks have a textured background and decorative borders. For example, a monster stat block uses \<div class="block monster frame"\> – this yields a tinted parchment background (\#faf2cc, a pale parchment color)[\[4\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/692360748/HB-PsionicFeats#:~:text=%2F,color%20%3A%20%23faf2cc%3B) and a distinctive border. The PHB CSS often uses border-image slices for ornate borders on frames: e.g. .page .note and .page .descriptive use image slices to create fancy edges[\[5\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/692360748/HB-PsionicFeats#:~:text=%2F,4mm%200%201mm%3B)[\[6\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/692360748/HB-PsionicFeats#:~:text=%2F,outset%20%3A%204px%3B). The monster frame likely also uses a border-image or at least a solid border – by default it has a light parchment background and black border lines. (In user tweaks, we see .block.monster.frame { background-image: unset; background-color: \#0000004d; } to give it a semi-transparent black fill[\[7\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/homebrewery/comments/qwjv00/how_do_you_change_the_background_color_pattern_of/#:~:text=...%20www.reddit.com%20%20.block.monster.frame%20,opacity), indicating that originally a background texture was present.) In summary, applying .frame to a block will give it a printed card look: colored background and border. We will leverage this for character sheet sections (ability score boxes, skill list, etc.), likely with some custom adjustments (since the existing frame styles are tuned for notes/monsters).

**.monster:** A content-specific class used in conjunction with .frame to style **monster stat blocks**. The .monster class triggers specific typography and layout for monster stat entries. For example, inside a .monster.frame block, headings and text use a sans-serif font (“Scaly Sans”) for stat labels and a smaller italic for flavor text. The PHB CSS defines rules like .page .monster.frame { background-color: \#faf2cc; } for the monster stat block background[\[4\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/692360748/HB-PsionicFeats#:~:text=%2F,color%20%3A%20%23faf2cc%3B), and likely styles the \<h4\> (monster name), \<hr\> dividers, \<dl\> definitions, etc. (e.g., monster **Ability scores table** and **Features** are formatted in columns, with horizontal rules separating sections). While a character sheet is not a monster stat block, understanding .monster.frame is useful – it shows how a frame can contain a complex layout. For instance, the monster block uses multiple \<hr\> lines and definition lists which the CSS styles (the horizontal rules in .monster.frame are thick black or decorative lines[\[8\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/gmbinder/comments/snrxn4/any_advice_on_converting_this_to_gm_binder_im/#:~:text=Any%20advice%20on%20converting%20this,.block.monster.frame.Black%20hr)). For the character sheet, we will likely create analogous structures (lots of framed sections), but we may define a new class (e.g. .character) rather than reuse .monster, to avoid undesired monster-specific styles.

**.note and .descriptive:** These are additional frame variants in the PHB theme. **.note** typically denotes a sidebar or important note in a tinted box, and **.descriptive** is used for descriptive text boxes. In the CSS, these classes are applied to .block.frame elements to give unique styling. For example, .page .note has a light teal/gray background (\#d1dcdb) and uses a special border image (providing a fancy border)[\[5\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/692360748/HB-PsionicFeats#:~:text=%2F,4mm%200%201mm%3B). Likewise, .page .descriptive has a pale gray background (\#e8eded) with its own border image styling[\[6\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/692360748/HB-PsionicFeats#:~:text=%2F,outset%20%3A%204px%3B). In the monster statblock HTML, the flavor text was wrapped in \<div class="block descriptive"\>. However, the monster’s descriptive text was *italicized* rather than given a shaded box. (The theme likely has a rule to handle .monster .descriptive differently, so it just italicizes the text without the background, aligning with the Monster Manual style.) For our purposes, .note and .descriptive illustrate that we can define new subclasses of .frame for different looks. A “character sheet” frame could be a new variant as well, if we want a distinct style for PC info boxes.

**.spellList:** A class for spell listings in the PHB style. The Homebrewery includes a **Spell List snippet** which formats spells in multiple columns. The PHB CSS sets .spellList elements to use multiple newspaper-style columns inside them. By default, a .phb .spellList spanning the full page is split into 3–4 columns for compact listing[\[9\]](https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery/issues/1274#:~:text=Spell%20List%20snippet%20is%20missing,span%3A). (In fact, an issue note indicates that adding the wide class to a spellList makes it span the page and use 4 columns[\[10\]](https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery/issues/1274#:~:text=Spell%20List%20snippet%20is%20missing,span%3A), whereas a non-wide spellList might be confined to one column region.) We will use .spellList on the spellcasting page to neatly arrange spells. The text inside is typically smaller and uses the sans-serif font for spell names (by default, the PHB CSS applies the ScalySans font to spell list entries for readability[\[1\]](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L0WUSjJyFHG7PDyIFta#:~:text=...%20spellList%7B%20font,fill%3Aauto)). We can populate a .spellList with spells grouped by level; the CSS will handle the column layout automatically.

**Headings and Text:** The PHB theme also defines styles for headings (h1–h5) and paragraphs. For example, headings in a .page.phb use specific fonts and sizes – e.g. .phb h1 is large (\~0.99 cm) and spans columns[\[3\]](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L0WUSjJyFHG7PDyIFta/-L71An5UlOm6NaHGBsZZ/source#:~:text=GM%20Binder%20Styling%20Reference%20,H3%20%60%60%60), .phb h2 and h3 progressively smaller[\[3\]](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L0WUSjJyFHG7PDyIFta/-L71An5UlOm6NaHGBsZZ/source#:~:text=GM%20Binder%20Styling%20Reference%20,H3%20%60%60%60). The font used for headings is the same BookSanity serif (with some letter-spacing and color adjustments to mimic the official look). Paragraphs (.page p) are styled with a **line-height \~1.3** and small spacing between them. The theme also indents the first line of consecutive paragraphs (e.g. if one paragraph follows another, an indent of \~1 em is added). Lists (\<ul\> \<ol\>) get custom bullet styles and margins consistent with the PHB book format. All these typographic details mean that any text we put into the character sheet (features, backstory, etc.) will automatically look like book text – nicely spaced and with appropriate font styling – as long as it’s inside a .page.phb. We will take advantage of this by using semantic elements (e.g. headings for section labels, regular paragraphs for descriptive text) so that the existing PHB CSS applies the correct look.

## Layout of the Three-Page Character Sheet (HTML/JSX Template)

Using the above conventions, we can construct the character sheet in **three .page.phb sections**: Page 1 for core stats, Page 2 for features/equipment, and Page 3 for spellcasting. Each page’s content will be structured into logical frames (using .block.frame containers). Below is a sample layout outline:

\<div class="page phb" id="page1"\>  
  \<div class="columnWrapper"\>  
    \<\!-- Page 1: Core Stats & Combat \--\>  
    \<h1 class="wide"\>Character Name\</h1\>  \<\!-- Character Name spans both columns \--\>

    \<div class="block frame" id="abilities"\>   
      \<\!-- Ability Scores block: six ability score boxes \--\>  
      \<\!-- Each ability could be a sub-div or list item with score & modifier \--\>  
    \</div\>

    \<div class="block frame" id="saves-skills"\>  
      \<\!-- Saving Throws & Skills block (probably left column under abilities) \--\>  
      \<\!-- Contains a list of saving throws and skills, marking proficiencies \--\>  
    \</div\>

    \<div class="block frame" id="combat-stats"\>  
      \<\!-- Combat Stats: Armor Class, Initiative, Speed, etc., and perhaps Passive Perception \--\>  
      \<\!-- These can be arranged in a small grid or list inside the frame \--\>  
    \</div\>

    \<div class="block frame" id="hp-hitdice-death"\>  
      \<\!-- Hit Points, Temporary HP, Hit Dice, Death Saves \--\>  
      \<\!-- E.g., a table or two-column layout inside to align labels and values, plus checkboxes for Death Saves \--\>  
    \</div\>

    \<div class="block frame" id="attacks-spellcasting"\>  
      \<\!-- Attacks & Spellcasting section (weapon attacks, attack bonus, damage) \--\>  
      \<\!-- This could be a table: the PHB CSS will style table rows with alternating shading\[11\] \--\>  
      \<table\>  
        \<thead\>\<tr\>\<th\>Attack\</th\>\<th\>Bonus\</th\>\<th\>Damage/Type\</th\>\</tr\>\</thead\>  
        \<tbody\>  
          \<tr\>\<td\>Longsword\</td\>\<td\>+5\</td\>\<td\>1d8+3 slashing\</td\>\</tr\>  
          \<\!-- ... \--\>  
        \</tbody\>  
      \</table\>  
    \</div\>

    \<div class="block frame" id="equipment-currency"\>  
      \<\!-- Equipment & Currency carried (could also spill to page 2 if lengthy) \--\>  
      \<\!-- e.g., a list of items and a table for coin counts \--\>  
    \</div\>

  \</div\>  
\</div\>

\<div class="page phb" id="page2"\>  
  \<div class="columnWrapper"\>  
    \<\!-- Page 2: Background, Proficiencies, Features \--\>  
    \<div class="block frame" id="proficiencies-languages"\>  
      \<h4\>Proficiencies & Languages\</h4\>  
      \<ul\>

        \<\!-- etc. \--\>  
      \</ul\>  
    \</div\>

    \<div class="block frame" id="features-traits"\>  
      \<h4\>Features & Traits\</h4\>

      \<\!-- etc. \--\>  
    \</div\>

      \<p\>\<em\>Backstory:\</em\> Born the third son of a minor lord, ... (full background text).\</p\>  
    \</div\>  
  \</div\>  
\</div\>

\<div class="page phb" id="page3"\>

      \</div\>  
    \</div\>  
  \</div\>  
\</div\>

In the above JSX/HTML template:

* Each page is a \<div class="page phb"\> with its own content wrapped in a .columnWrapper. This ensures the PHB styles (columns, fonts, background) apply per page.

* **Page 1** (Core Stats) is broken into multiple frames: abilities, saves/skills, combat stats, HP/HD/Death Saves, attacks, equipment. These are stacked in order. Because of the two-column layout, content will flow automatically: for example, the Abilities frame might fill the left column entirely, and then the next frame (Skills) will start below it and might flow to the right column if it doesn't fit. We can control column breaks if needed by inserting an empty div.column-break (with CSS break-before: column) or by adjusting content length. The Homebrewery approach is to let content naturally flow and use \\column breaks in the source if a section should start in the next column[\[12\]](https://github.com/bmack08/Mythforge/blob/a95d4cdb805f7fe16009cbb356d731b0625729d5/client/homebrew/brewRenderer/brewRenderer.jsx#L24-L32). We may do similarly if precise placement is needed (e.g., force “Attacks & Spellcasting” to top of right column on page 1).

* **Page 2** (Features/Equipment) contains Proficiencies, Features, and Backstory in their own .frame blocks. These will flow into the two columns of page 2\. For instance, Proficiencies might occupy left column and part of right, and then Features start next, etc., depending on content length. Since these are text-heavy, the balanced columns will make use of the full page height. We can use \<h4\> or styled headings for section titles; the PHB CSS will style h4 as a small heading (BookSanity font, perhaps small caps) appropriate for subsection titles.

* **Page 3** (Spellcasting) is made **full-width** by using a .block.frame.wide. This is because we likely want the spell list to span the whole page with multiple columns inside it. By giving the spellcasting section class="block frame wide", it will break out of the two-column layout and use its own column structure inside. Indeed, the \<div class="spellList wide"\> inside is set to column-count:4 by the theme when wide[\[10\]](https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery/issues/1274#:~:text=Spell%20List%20snippet%20is%20missing,span%3A), so spells will arrange in four columns across the page (as in a spellbook style). We included an example where each spell level is labeled with an \<h5\> and spells listed in a \<p\>; the PHB styles will handle the typography (the h5 will be italicized or small text by theme, and the columns will fill with spells).

This template is just a guideline – in a React component, each of these sections could be separate sub-components, but the class structure would remain as shown. The key is that we use **existing PHB classes** (page phb, columnWrapper, wide, block frame, etc.) to get the baseline styling, and we organize the HTML to match the expected layout (multi-column text flow with framed sections).

## Component Mapping: Sections to CSS Classes

Each part of the character sheet can be mapped to the PHB style classes and structures:

* **Page Container:** Use \<div class="page phb"\> for each sheet page. This applies the overall PHB page styling – two columns, parchment background, correct font and size, and automatic page breaks in print.

* **Column Layout:** Within each page, include a \<div class="columnWrapper"\>. This div makes the page content flow in columns. We generally allow the browser to flow content, but can insert manual column breaks as needed (e.g., an empty element with break-before: column CSS, similar to Homebrewery’s \\column marker[\[12\]](https://github.com/bmack08/Mythforge/blob/a95d4cdb805f7fe16009cbb356d731b0625729d5/client/homebrew/brewRenderer/brewRenderer.jsx#L24-L32)).

* **Character Name Header:** For the character name at the top, we can simply use an \<h1\> or \<h2\> element with class wide (or wrap it in a .wide block). The PHB CSS will render an h1 in a large, decorative style and by adding wide it will span both columns[\[3\]](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L0WUSjJyFHG7PDyIFta/-L71An5UlOm6NaHGBsZZ/source#:~:text=GM%20Binder%20Styling%20Reference%20,H3%20%60%60%60). For example: \<h1 class="wide"\>Eragon\</h1\> would center across the page. (If more styling is needed – e.g., a specific border under the name – we could wrap it in a .frame, but the official sheet just has a line, which could be achieved with a bottom border on the h1 via custom CSS.)

* **Ability Scores Block:** Use a \<div class="block frame" id="abilities"\> to contain the six ability scores. Inside it, we might not have pre-defined classes from Homebrewery, so we will structure it manually: e.g., a 3×2 table or six small \<div\>s. Each ability could be a mini-box with the score and modifier. We can style those inner elements with custom CSS (e.g., make a circle or box for the score). The .frame class on the parent gives us a bordered container[\[4\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/692360748/HB-PsionicFeats#:~:text=%2F,color%20%3A%20%23faf2cc%3B), so it will visually group the abilities. (Alternatively, we could create six separate .block.frame small boxes for each ability score if we want them truly distinct. But the official sheet groups abilities in one section, so one frame containing all is reasonable.)

* **Saving Throws & Skills:** These can be listed in one framed section (e.g., \<div class="block frame" id="saves-skills"\>). We can use a \<ul\> for skills and perhaps another \<ul\> or simply paragraphs for saving throws. The PHB CSS will style list items with proper bullets or indentation; we may want to override the bullet since the official sheet uses a dot or checkbox to denote proficiency. One approach is to use the ✔ or **●** symbol to mark proficient skills, or simply bold the proficiency. No specific Homebrewery class exists for “skill list”, so we rely on default list styling and perhaps add a custom class (like .skills) for minor tweaks (e.g. to reduce spacing). The frame ensures the whole list is on a parchment backdrop with a border. *(If the list is long, it will naturally flow into the second column of the page – likely we’ll have abilities and skills in the left column, and the list continues to top of right column.)*

* **Armor Class / Initiative / Speed:** These are usually small fields in the top-middle of the official sheet. We can group them into one .block.frame (e.g., \<div class="block frame" id="combat-stats"\>). Inside, a simple table or a series of short \<p\> can place the AC, Initiative, and Speed values with labels. The PHB CSS doesn’t have a custom class for these, but using \<strong\> or \<span\> for labels will make them bold (the theme sets \<strong\> weight and letter-spacing to look good). We might use a little custom CSS here to layout three values side by side (e.g., a 3-column internal table with borders only at the outside). The .frame gives a nice border around all three stats together, akin to the official layout’s central stats box.

* **Hit Points, Hit Dice, Death Saves:** We propose another framed block (\<div class="block frame" id="hp-hitdice-death"\>) to contain these related statistics. Inside, we can have a two-column layout: one side for Hit Points (Current HP and Temporary HP), the other for Hit Dice and Death Saves. For instance, a simple table with two columns can work: left cell lists “Hit Point Maximum”, “Current Hit Points”, “Temporary Hit Points”, and right cell lists “Total Hit Dice” and “Death Saves”. Checkboxes for death save successes/failures can be small Unicode circles or check marks that the user fills. There’s no built-in checkbox styling in the PHB CSS (since it’s not an interactive sheet), so we’d either inline small symbols or leave blank underscores for pen-and-paper filling. Still, the bordered frame will visually separate this section. (If desired, we could create small sub-frames for Death Saves to resemble the 3 checkbox boxes – e.g., three tiny .frame squares – but that likely requires custom CSS. A simpler method is just to print ○○○ and ●●● for empty/filled circles.)

* **Attacks & Spellcasting:** We use a .block.frame for this section as well. Inside, an HTML \<table\> is appropriate to list attacks (weapon or spell attacks). The PHB theme will automatically stripe the table rows (odd rows get a slight gray background) and set a minimal style[\[11\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/692360748/HB-PsionicFeats#:~:text=%2F,color%20%3A%20%23e3e8e8%3B). The table header can use \<th\> for “Attack Name”, “Atk Bonus”, “Damage/Type”, etc. The body lists each weapon or attack. We should ensure the table fits in one column – if it’s wide, we give the containing frame the wide class to span both columns. In our design, we kept it within one column (it will likely sit at the bottom of the first column or top of second column on page 1). The font inside tables is inherited (serif for text, but we could add class="sans" somewhere if we wanted a sans-serif in tables – Homebrewery’s default for tables is serif unless specified). The official sheet has a dedicated area for attacks, but representing it as a simple table on the frame achieves a similar look, with the frame’s border acting as the outline of the attacks box.

* **Equipment & Treasure:** The inventory can spill from page 1 to page 2 if needed. We allocated an equipment-currency frame on page 1 for items and coin totals. If the character has a lot of gear, this list might continue onto page 2 (which is fine – the content will flow into page 2’s columns automatically, or we can break it at a page boundary). We can format equipment as a list of item names (possibly with quantities or weights). Currency (GP, SP, CP, etc.) might be a small table or just a series of labels with values. There’s no special class for inventory, so we use basic elements. The .frame will give it a distinct boundary. (Optionally, we could use multiple frames: one for equipment, one for currency, if we want separate boxes like the official sheet. This would be done by splitting into two .block.frame sections.)

* **Proficiencies & Languages:** On page 2, we have this in its own frame. It’s essentially a list (\<ul\> of languages, tool proficiencies, etc.). The theme’s list styling (bullet points) will apply; we might prefer a cleaner look (the official sheet uses a comma-separated list or just lines of text). To align with the PHB style, we can leave it as a list or use \<p\> with line breaks. Either is fine – the frame’s presence is the main visual cue, and bold labels can be used as needed. For example, we put a heading \<h4\>Proficiencies & Languages\</h4\> inside the frame to clearly label the section – the PHB CSS will render h4 in a small-caps serif style that matches the sheet’s section headers[\[13\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/692360748/HB-PsionicFeats#:~:text=.page%20h3%20%7B%20border,1px%3B).

* **Features & Traits:** This will likely be a long text section. We wrap it in a .frame so it has a border. Inside, we simply list features as paragraphs or a definition list. We can make feature names bold by using \<strong\> (the theme will slightly embolden and shrink letter spacing for bold text). Our example shows using \<p\>\<strong\>Feature Name:\</strong\> description...\</p\> which yields a bold feature name followed by regular text – this mimics the official sheet’s style of listing features. Thanks to the PHB CSS, the paragraphs will have minimal spacing between them and will be nicely justified (if we wanted exact formatting, we might add a small margin after each feature; the theme by default might already do p \+ p { text-indent: 1em; } which indents second paragraphs, but since we put each feature in its own \<p\> with a bold label, the indent rule won’t trigger for the first line after a bold label). Overall, this section will look like regular PHB text in a bordered box.

* **Backstory and Notes:** We combined these in a frame (Background Info). This could include role-playing info like Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, Flaws, and a general backstory. We can format those with italic labels (as shown with \<em\>Personality:\</em\> etc.) to distinguish them. The PHB CSS will render \<em\> as italic. We might also use a smaller heading or bold for “Backstory”. Since this is freeform text, we rely on the theme’s paragraph styling for a book-like appearance. The frame keeps it separate from other sections. (If desired, each sub-part could be its own small frame, but the official sheet groups them, so one frame is fine.)

* **Spellcasting Section:** Page 3 is dedicated to spells. We made this a full-width frame (.block.frame.wide) because typically the official spell sheet is one column (the whole page) with many columns of spell names inside. Using wide ensures the content is not constrained to the two half-page columns but instead can utilize the full page width. Inside, we placed a \<h2\> title “Spellcasting” that spans columns – with class wide it will center across the top[\[3\]](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L0WUSjJyFHG7PDyIFta/-L71An5UlOm6NaHGBsZZ/source#:~:text=GM%20Binder%20Styling%20Reference%20,H3%20%60%60%60). We then list some stats (spell save DC, etc.) in a paragraph. Below that, we use the .spellList wide construct: this is a \<div class="spellList wide"\> containing spells grouped by level. Thanks to the PHB CSS, this element will automatically split into multiple columns (approximately four columns across) to list spells[\[9\]](https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery/issues/1274#:~:text=Spell%20List%20snippet%20is%20missing,span%3A). Each spell level is labeled with an \<h5\> in our example; the theme likely styles h5 as a small, possibly italic heading (the snippet shows .page h5 { text-shadow: \#000 0px 0px 0.1px; } for subtle outline[\[14\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/692360748/HB-PsionicFeats#:~:text=%7D%20.page%20h5%20%7B%20text,1px%3B)). The spells themselves can be in \<p\> or just text separated by commas or line breaks. We might indicate prepared spells with a checkmark (✔) or italicize scroll-only spells – those are manual conventions, not from CSS. The important part is that .spellList.wide will ensure the spells are in multi-column format that fills the page nicely[\[10\]](https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery/issues/1274#:~:text=Spell%20List%20snippet%20is%20missing,span%3A). If a character isn’t a spellcaster, this page could be repurposed for additional notes or simply omitted.

The above mapping shows that **most character sheet sections can be implemented by reusing Homebrewery’s PHB CSS classes**, primarily .frame for bordered boxes and the base typography for text. We anticipate creating one or two **new CSS classes** for minor adjustments – for instance, a class for marking proficient skills (to add a checkmark or bold style), or a class to style the small circles for Death Save checkboxes. But structurally, the existing classes cover the major layout needs (columns, frames, headings, lists, tables, etc.).

Notably, we might choose to define a new .character.frame class in the CSS, similar to .monster.frame, to fine-tune the look of character sheet frames. For example, .character.frame could have a simpler border (solid lines) if we don’t want the decorative image borders of notes/monsters. This could be done by extending the CSS: e.g. .page .character.frame { background-color: \#faf2cc; border: 1px solid \#000; } (as an approximation of the official sheet’s boxes, which are plain black-lined). Homebrewery’s .monster.frame is fairly close – it already provides a parchment background and a border effect – but it also affects internal typography (like using ScalySans for monster stat text). We likely do not want monster-specific font changes for a PC sheet. Therefore, introducing a new class for character sheet frames is wise so we can customize the font or layout inside those boxes without interfering with monster stat blocks. In summary, *it’s technically possible to reuse .monster.frame.wide and override some styles*, but creating dedicated character sheet styles will be cleaner.

## Visual Style Guide (PHB Theme)

The PHB stylesheet provides a polished D\&D look that we will adhere to for our character sheet. Key style characteristics include:

* **Fonts & Typography:** The primary font is a **serif font** called *BookSanity* (a replacement for the book-style font used in 5e handbooks) for most text. Headings and body text use this serif. A secondary font, *Scaly Sans* (an Open Sans variant), is used in certain parts for readability – for example, monster stat blocks use a sans-serif for numerical data and spell lists use it for spell names[\[1\]](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L0WUSjJyFHG7PDyIFta#:~:text=...%20spellList%7B%20font,fill%3Aauto). We should load/include these fonts. The character sheet can mostly use the serif font for a classic look, but we might use the sans-serif for very small text (like labels or the spells section) to improve legibility. Text sizes in the PHB theme are generally smaller than standard web – base font is 13px (roughly 9pt). Headings scale up: h1 \~ 24pt, h2 \~ 18pt, etc., defined in cm units in CSS (h1 \~0.987cm, h2 \~0.705cm… as seen in a GM Binder reference)[\[3\]](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L0WUSjJyFHG7PDyIFta/-L71An5UlOm6NaHGBsZZ/source#:~:text=GM%20Binder%20Styling%20Reference%20,H3%20%60%60%60). We’ll rely on those definitions: for instance, an \<h4\> in a frame will appear as a small capped heading consistent with PHB subsection titles. **Line height** is about 1.2–1.3 for body text, giving a dense but readable paragraph. Paragraphs after a heading or frame title start non-indented, but consecutive paragraphs indent the first line by \~1 em, just like in novel print style. We will see this in feature descriptions or backstory text. We should also note that the theme applies some **text effects**: e.g., bold text (\<strong\>) is not overly heavy (font-weight \~800 with slight letter-spacing reduction) to mimic the D\&D style of bold small caps, and \<em\> is italicized for emphasis. There is also a subtle text-shadow on certain headers (to ensure white text on dark backgrounds is readable, or black text on textured background stands out)[\[14\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/692360748/HB-PsionicFeats#:~:text=%7D%20.page%20h5%20%7B%20text,1px%3B). Overall, our character sheet will inherit a **print-optimized, highly legible typography** from PHB CSS – we should avoid overriding these, except perhaps to ensure very small text (like the labels “STR”, “DEX” by ability scores) are clear (we might choose to apply the sans-serif for those labels manually if needed).

* **Colors:** The color scheme is parchment and ink. The **page background** is a parchment texture (faded beige). Within frames, the default background color is a light parchment off-white (\#faf2cc for monster stat blocks)[\[4\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/692360748/HB-PsionicFeats#:~:text=%2F,color%20%3A%20%23faf2cc%3B) or light gray (\#e8eded for descriptive, \#d1dcdb for note) for contrast. We will likely use the parchment tone for character info boxes to maintain the look. Text is primarily **black** (\#000)[\[1\]](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L0WUSjJyFHG7PDyIFta#:~:text=...%20spellList%7B%20font,fill%3Aauto). Some headings or decorative elements might be colored; e.g., the official PHB has red accents for certain headers, but the Homebrewery PHB theme largely sticks to black/dark gray for text and uses background color for accent. We might see slightly colored lines (the snippet shows an h3 with border-bottom: 2px solid \#d7c598, a tan color, possibly for certain headings)[\[13\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/692360748/HB-PsionicFeats#:~:text=.page%20h3%20%7B%20border,1px%3B). For simplicity, character sheet fields will be black text on light background. If we want to differentiate section labels (like “Features & Traits”), we could leave them black or use the theme’s small-caps styling rather than introducing new colors. The **borders** on frames are effectively black or dark – for example, note boxes have a border image that appears as a dark textured edge, and the monster statblock has black border lines. So the outline of each character sheet panel will be in dark gray/black, ensuring high contrast. Interactive elements on a printed sheet (like checkboxes for Death Saves or inspiration) are just black outlines – we will mimic those with ○ or ■ characters (black on white). In sum: **print-friendly high contrast** is maintained (and the CSS even forces exact color printing so the parchment isn’t washed out).

* **Borders & Frames:** All major sections on the sheet are enclosed in **frames with borders** to resemble the official sheet’s separated boxes. The PHB CSS uses images for fancy borders in some cases[\[5\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/692360748/HB-PsionicFeats#:~:text=%2F,4mm%200%201mm%3B), but for a character sheet we might opt for simpler lines. The monster stat block frame, for instance, likely has a thin black border around with perhaps thicker line at top/bottom. In our design, using .block.frame will by default apply whatever border logic the theme has. If it uses border-image and we don’t override, our boxes might get those slight ornamentations (which could actually be nice). For example, .page .descriptive frame uses a specific border image with 12px slices[\[6\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/692360748/HB-PsionicFeats#:~:text=%2F,outset%20%3A%204px%3B) – if we reuse that without the class, we might get no border. Thus, we might explicitly add a border. We can either create a custom .character.frame style with a straightforward border (e.g., border: 0.5mm solid \#000; border-radius: 4px if rounding is desired) or see if using the note/descriptive classes is appropriate. The official sheet’s boxes have a unique art-deco corner, which we likely won’t replicate exactly, but a clean black border is sufficient to convey the structure. Border **thickness** in the PHB theme is often specified in mm for print precision – e.g., the note border-image width is \~11px which corresponds to about 0.4 mm on print[\[5\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/692360748/HB-PsionicFeats#:~:text=%2F,4mm%200%201mm%3B). We saw an example of a user customizing monster frames with a 0.6 mm solid border[\[8\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/gmbinder/comments/snrxn4/any_advice_on_converting_this_to_gm_binder_im/#:~:text=Any%20advice%20on%20converting%20this,.block.monster.frame.Black%20hr). So roughly **0.5 mm (around 1.5px)** is a good line weight for our frames: thick enough to see, but not too heavy. Horizontal rules (\<hr\>) inside frames (like those in the statblock) are also styled: typically 1–2px solid lines or decorative separators. We’ll likely use simple \<hr\> for separating sections (like between HP and Death Saves) – the PHB CSS might render them as a thin line or we can add a style (the monster stat block’s \<hr\> appears as a bold line separating sections, likely because .monster.frame hr is styled with a thick solid line or image). We may not need many \<hr\> in the character sheet aside from possibly under the character name or between big sections, but it’s good to know they can be styled via the theme or custom CSS if needed.

* **Spacing & Alignment:** The PHB CSS has been tuned for print layout, so it uses a mix of relative (em, %) and absolute (cm, mm) units for spacing to ensure things look correct on paper. Within our sheet:

* **Page Margins:** The .page.phb padding (1.4 cm top, \~1.9 cm sides) establishes margins so content isn’t cut off. We should ensure our printer settings either have no additional margin or only minimal (the CSS is assuming full-bleed background; to print, one must enable background graphics and maybe use narrow margins since \~1.9 cm is already the intended margin).

* **Gutters:** The 0.9 cm column-gap is the space between the two text columns on a page. This is wide enough that our framed boxes won’t collide or feel cramped at the center fold. We shouldn’t need to adjust this.

* **Section Margins:** By default, if we stack .block.frame elements, there will be some margin naturally (the multi-column flow will put some space, and the PHB CSS might have something like .page .frame { margin: 4mm 0; } implicitly via the note styles[\[15\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/692360748/HB-PsionicFeats#:~:text=stretch%3B%20border,4mm%200%201mm%3B)). For example, .page .note has 4mm top margin[\[15\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/692360748/HB-PsionicFeats#:~:text=stretch%3B%20border,4mm%200%201mm%3B). We might get a similar effect or we can explicitly add a small margin-bottom to each frame to ensure they don’t touch. Consistent spacing between boxes (say \~0.5 cm) will make the sheet readable.

* **Internal Padding:** The content inside frames often is padded a bit from the border. The PHB note/descriptive styles use border-image-outset which effectively creates some padding via the border image. If we define our own border, we should add padding (e.g., 0.2 cm inside) so text isn’t flush against the border. The official sheet boxes have a small inner margin.

* **Labels and Fields:** We should align text within sections similar to the official sheet. For instance, ability scores might be centered in their small boxes, skill names left-aligned with dots or checkmarks on the left. We can use the theme’s alignment helpers or just basic CSS (text-align, etc.). The PHB CSS doesn’t provide specific utility classes for alignment, so we’ll just include style in our components (e.g., a center alignment for ability score numbers).

* **Page Breaks:** Each page is explicitly broken by the container, so we avoid any mid-frame page breaks. The printing flow will treat each .page as a unit (thanks to page-break-before: always on each page div). We should also ensure that multi-page content like a long list doesn’t accidentally overflow a frame across pages. If a frame’s content is too long for one page, it will overflow (since each .page is a fixed-height container). It’s better to split content between pages manually (e.g., if Equipment is very long, put some in page 1 and overflow into a similar frame on page 2). The Homebrewery approach is manual in this regard – content must be sized to page. For React, we might calculate if something exceeds a page and adjust, but that’s beyond styling – as a rule, **each .page should contain content that fits within 279.4mm height**. The max-height: 100% on .columnWrapper and overflow: hidden on .page will cut off overflow, so we have to be mindful when adding content.

* **Print Considerations:** Because our goal is a printable character sheet, we rely on the PHB CSS’s print optimization. The CSS already includes @media print adjustments and uses absolute units (mm, cm) for accuracy. It also sets \* { \-webkit-print-color-adjust: exact; } to ensure the background and colors print without fading. We should instruct users to print with background graphics enabled (to get the parchment effect and frame fills). If needed, we can add a note in CSS to force a white background for frames when printing in black-and-white, but since it’s a color sheet, likely users will print in color. We may also consider adding break-inside: avoid; on important frames to prevent the browser from splitting a frame’s content between columns or pages. For example, a long feature description could theoretically split across the two columns of page 2 in an awkward spot; adding break-inside: avoid on the .frame class might keep each frame’s content in one column as much as possible. Homebrewery’s default for columns is balanced fill, which can cause a tall frame to be split evenly – their code hack of injecting a \\column at page end switches column-fill to auto when wide elements are present[\[12\]](https://github.com/bmack08/Mythforge/blob/a95d4cdb805f7fe16009cbb356d731b0625729d5/client/homebrew/brewRenderer/brewRenderer.jsx#L24-L32). In our case, most frames are not extremely tall, but if one is, we might temporarily sacrifice perfect balance to keep the frame together. This can be handled with CSS like .page.phb .frame { break-inside: avoid-column; } (modern property) so that each framed box stays intact in one column. This way, a feature won’t start at the bottom of left column and finish at top of right – it will instead move entirely to the next column if it doesn’t fit. This is a desirable outcome for a clean layout.

In summary, **DungeonMind’s character sheet** will leverage the Homebrewery PHB styles to achieve an authentic D\&D look. We will use **multi-column layouts**, **framed sections**, and the **established fonts, spacing, and print rules** of the PHB theme to ensure the sheet looks like it came straight out of the Player’s Handbook. By mapping each character sheet element to these styles (as detailed above), we minimize custom CSS and maximize consistency with known 5e aesthetics. The result will be a three-page sheet with clearly delineated panels for stats, exactly like official sheets but rendered using React components and Homebrewery’s robust CSS foundation. All printing and layout concerns (page sizing, margins, column flow, page breaks) are handled by following the Homebrewery conventions, so the final output will be easy to print or export to PDF with correct formatting.
