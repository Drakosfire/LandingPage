# Technical Analysis of 5etools Architecture and Data Structures

## Data Organization and Architecture of 5etools

**JSON-Based Content Storage:** The 5etools project stores all game data (spells, classes, items, monsters, etc.) as structured JSON files. Each file typically contains an array of entries of a given type (e.g. spells, classes) along with a metadata section. For example, the spells data is split by source book – there is an index mapping source abbreviations (like “PHB” for Player’s Handbook, “XGE” for Xanathar’s Guide) to specific JSON files (e.g. "PHB": "spells-phb.json" in data/spells/index.json[\[1\]](https://github.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-src/blob/ee4ee91dec68d867a05e5e17fb53ef49f02b9461/data/spells/index.json#L2-L10)). This allows 5etools to load content modularly per source. Every data entry includes a "source" field with a book code, enabling filtering of SRD-only content by including or excluding sources. (The site’s **Manage Content** settings let users toggle sources to comply with SRD/OGL rules.) Notably, an older repository of SRD-only spells encourages using the more complete 5etools data instead, noting that the 5etools format “handles scaling, is much more complete, and has a better overall data structure”[\[2\]](https://github.com/vorpalhex/srd_spells#:~:text=Please%20use%205eTools%20data%20instead)[\[3\]](https://github.com/vorpalhex/srd_spells#:~:text=Open%20Game%20License%20v1,Wizards%20of%20the%20Coast%2C%20Inc).

**Metadata and Schema:** Each JSON file contains a top-level \_meta object describing the source and version. For homebrew or source files, the \_meta includes a "json" key (the source abbreviation) which all entries’ "source" must match[\[4\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Class#:~:text=%2A%20%60,entries%2C%20check%20the%20Renderer%20Demo). 5etools enforces a strict schema for its JSON data – a JSON Schema is provided to validate the structure of entries. Contributors use automated schema validation (e.g. a VSCode extension or test script) to ensure that files conform to the expected format[\[5\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/FromZeroToHero#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Schema%20validation). This guarantees consistency in keys and data types across thousands of entries. For instance, common fields like name (string), source (string code), and entries (rich text content) appear in many entry types. The entry content is stored in a structured way using a variety of field types: \- **Entries**: Most descriptive text is in an "entries" array, which can contain nested entries, lists, tables, etc., rather than a single large text string. The 5etools **Renderer** code interprets these to produce book-style formatting. \- **Inline Tags**: The text can include inline syntax like {@spell fireball} or {@item longsword}, which the renderer turns into hyperlinks or tooltips to other entries[\[6\]](https://github.com/QFrankQ/5etools-DnD-Rules-Markdown-Renderer/blob/bc2a490abdf80c509f42620ce1d471c5bd4d49b6/README.md#L40-L48). This provides dynamic cross-references in the UI without hardcoding hyperlinks.

**Client-Side Application:** Architecturally, 5etools is a static web app (pure HTML/JS/CSS) that loads the JSON data and renders interactive compendiums. Each compendium page (Spells, Classes, Items, etc.) is an HTML file that invokes common JS modules to fetch JSON and populate a table or list. The code is primarily in JavaScript (with some Handlebars templates for rendering)[\[7\]](https://github.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-src/tree/v2.16.0#:~:text=%2A%20%20JavaScript%2088.5,187). This design makes it easy to self-host and also means the “business logic” (like filtering or linking content) is handled in the browser. There is no server-side database – instead, the JSON files act as the database, loaded on demand. This approach is flexible: the same data and rendering code can run in Node for server-side use or conversion tools. In fact, the 5etools renderer is designed to be isomorphic (usable in Node.js), enabling projects like a Markdown converter to reuse 5etools rendering logic on the backend[\[8\]](https://github.com/QFrankQ/5etools-DnD-Rules-Markdown-Renderer/blob/bc2a490abdf80c509f42620ce1d471c5bd4d49b6/README.md#L211-L219).

**Rendering System:** The rendering system of 5etools is a key asset. It parses the structured entries and tags to produce formatted output (either HTML or text). It supports many entry types: e.g. "list" for bullet lists, "table" for tables, "entries" for general sections, "inset" for sidebars, etc.[\[9\]](https://github.com/QFrankQ/5etools-DnD-Rules-Markdown-Renderer/blob/bc2a490abdf80c509f42620ce1d471c5bd4d49b6/README.md#L33-L42). Special syntax is used for dice ({@dice 1d20}), damage ({@damage 8d6}), conditions ({@condition blinded}), and so on, making the rules text interactive and semantically rich[\[6\]](https://github.com/QFrankQ/5etools-DnD-Rules-Markdown-Renderer/blob/bc2a490abdf80c509f42620ce1d471c5bd4d49b6/README.md#L40-L48). This structured content approach is worth emulating in a rule engine: rather than storing plain text, data like spell descriptions are tokenized which allows dynamic linking and rich UI presentation. A **Renderer** module in 5etools takes these JSON entries and produces the final output. For example, the *RendererMarkdown* class can output clean Markdown from the same data[\[10\]](https://github.com/QFrankQ/5etools-DnD-Rules-Markdown-Renderer/blob/bc2a490abdf80c509f42620ce1d471c5bd4d49b6/README.md#L49-L57) – a technique that could be used to feed a rules engine or documentation generator. The takeaway is that separating content (data) from presentation (renderer) is a powerful pattern: our new system can ingest 5etools JSON and render it in React components or any format by writing a compatible renderer.

**SRD vs Non-SRD Content:** 5etools contains full official content (for personal use) but acknowledges the need to separate out SRD-only material for legal use. Thanks to the source tagging, this is straightforward. An SRD-only compendium can be built by including only entries with "source": "PHB" and a handful of other sources like "Basic Rules" or the “System Reference Document” itself. In many cases, the *Basic Rules* are a subset of PHB content; 5etools likely flags purely SRD content with an "srd": true in metadata. (In the snippet above, actions like “Attack” show "srd": true[\[11\]](https://gist.github.com/mirasrael/36e2c50899b4a627fbea7519459a2343#:~:text=%5C,Weapon%20Fighting%5C%22%5D%7D%2C%7B%5C%22name%5C%22%3A%5C%22Cast%20a%20Spell%5C%22%2C%5C%22source%5C%22%3A%5C%22PHB%5C%22%2C%5C%22page%5C%22%3A192%2C%5C%22srd%5C%22%3Atrue%2C%5C%22time%5C%22%3A%5B%5C%22Varies).) To build a 2024-SRD toolset, one can use 5etools data but simply filter out all entries from non-SRD sources. The 5etools architecture even supports this at runtime via a content blacklist feature that can exclude certain books or categories[\[12\]](https://5etools.magicalpixies.co.uk/changelog.html#:~:text=Changelog%20,independent%20of%20everything). Additionally, 5etools now maintains a separate “2014” edition site (the original 5e rules) which hints at how a future 2024 rules update could be handled in parallel – likely via separate data files or source codes for revised material[\[13\]](https://5e.tools/#:~:text=Other%20versions%3F%20A%20,as%20an%20archive%20of%20releases).

## Data Structures for Spells and Spellcasting

**Spell Data Format:** Spells in 5etools are represented with a rich schema that captures all their attributes and enables extensive filtering. A spell entry will include fields such as name, level, school, casting time, range, components, duration, and a detailed "entries" array for its description (including higher-level scaling effects). In addition, spells include lists of classes that can cast them. Rather than a simple text list, the data structure has classes.fromClassList (for base classes) and classes.fromSubclass (for subclass-granted spells). For example, *Fireball* would list Wizard, Sorcerer etc. in fromClassList. If a subclass like the *Eldritch Knight* fighter can cast *Fireball* (via its access to wizard spell list), 5etools doesn’t duplicate Fireball in a subclass list; instead, the logic **derives** it: in the spell filtering code, any spell available to Wizards is dynamically marked as available to Eldritch Knight (Fighter subclass) as well[\[14\]](https://github.com/kanguen/kanguen.github.io/blob/d21448aee58a72328afec21a949c0685e4fd0a3d/js/spells.js#L2-L10). Similarly, cleric spells are flagged for the *Divine Soul* Sorcerer subclass in code[\[15\]](https://github.com/kanguen/kanguen.github.io/blob/d21448aee58a72328afec21a949c0685e4fd0a3d/js/spells.js#L8-L16). This approach avoids manual duplication of spell lists across subclasses, though it means the rule engine needs to be aware of such relationships.

**Spellcasting Types – Known vs Prepared:** The distinction between “spells known” and “spells prepared” is handled in class data rather than on each spell. A Wizard and a Sorcerer might both have *Fireball* in their class list, but how many spells they can prepare or know is a function of class rules. 5etools class files encode this via **progression arrays** and class features. For example, classes that have a fixed number of spells known per level (like Sorcerer or Bard) include a spellsKnownProgression array of length 20, where each index gives the total spells known at that class level[\[16\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Subclass#:~:text=,6%2C%207%2C%208%2C%209%2C%2010). Classes that prepare spells (Cleric, Druid, Wizard) typically don’t have a fixed cap in the data (since they can prepare a number each day based on their level and ability mod), so they may omit spellsKnownProgression or use a placeholder. Cantrips known are similarly tracked with a cantripProgression array[\[17\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Subclass#:~:text=The%20amount%20of%20cantrips%20and,classes%20to%20import%20spell%20lists). Warlocks (pact magic users) likely use spellsKnownProgression as well (for their limited spells known), and their distinctive spell slot progression (always at highest level, refreshing on short rest) is represented in the class’s table text rather than an explicit field. However, the **class table groups** mechanism in 5etools lets Warlock have separate columns for “Slots” and “Slot Level” by level. In general, 5etools data is optimized for display and lookup, so some dynamic aspects (like *how many slots per level for a full caster*) are not encoded as data fields but can be derived from tables or known formulas.

**Always Prepared & Expanded Spell Lists:** Some subclasses grant always-prepared spells (e.g. Cleric domains, Paladin Oaths) or expanded spell options (e.g. Warlock patron expanded list). The 5etools subclass schema includes fields for these. An additionalSpells block can specify spells a character **always has prepared** at certain levels, or **always knows**, etc., categorized by type[\[18\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Subclass#:~:text=%2A%20%60,cast%20spells%20in%20this%20group)[\[19\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Subclass#:~:text=,pass%20without%20trace%7CPHB). For instance, the Life Cleric might list specific spells under "prepared": { "1": \[...\], "3": \[...\] } in additionalSpells to denote domain spells always prepared at those levels. There are also subclassSpells arrays for cases where a subclass adds spells to the class’s spell list (for selection rather than automatic prep)[\[20\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Subclass#:~:text=spell%20resources%20%2A%20%60,racial). Warlock patrons use this for their expanded spell list (marked under "expanded" category). By encoding these in data, 5etools allows the UI to display them on subclass pages and helps VTT integrations know about bonus spells. Our rule engine can leverage the same approach: subclass definitions can carry their bonus spells, categorized by whether they are free known/prepared or just additional options.

**Spell Filtering UI:** On the 5etools spells page, users can filter spells by many facets – class, level, school, casting time, components, damage type, saving throw, etc. These filters are driven by explicit data fields in each spell entry. For example, if a spell inflicts a certain damage type or causes a condition, the JSON entry often has tags like "damageInflict": \["fire"\] or "conditionInflict": \["stunned"\]. Similarly, a spell that requires a saving throw might list the ability in "savingThrow": \["DEX"\]. These extra fields allow building filters without parsing the text. 5etools also uses tag arrays like "spellTags" for things like *ritual*, *concentration*, or specific niches (e.g. “Summoning” or “Healing” tags). The result is a very granular dataset ideal for a rule engine that might want to, say, retrieve “all evocation spells of 3rd level or lower that deal fire damage and are available to Druids.” In 5etools, this query can be accomplished by combining filters on the UI. The underlying code transforms class selections into filter matches by using the classes.fromClassList and fromSubclass data. As noted, it even populates internal fields like \_fClasses and \_fSubclasses for each spell on load for quick comparison[\[21\]](https://github.com/kanguen/kanguen.github.io/blob/d21448aee58a72328afec21a949c0685e4fd0a3d/js/spells.js#L14-L17). We can emulate this by indexing spells by which classes can use them. One idea is to generate a map of Class \-\> Spells at import time using the 5etools data, including subclass allowances, so our character builder can easily present spell options for a given class or subclass.

## Class, Subclass, and Feature Data Structure

**Class-Feature Separation:** One of the most significant design patterns in 5etools is how it represents player classes and their features. Classes are essentially treated as *containers* of features, and those features are defined in a separate list. In the JSON, a class file has two arrays: "class" and "classFeature" (and similarly "subclass" and "subclassFeature" for subclasses)[\[22\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Class#:~:text=,)[\[23\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Class#:~:text=%7B%20,%5D). The class entry itself contains high-level info (hit dice, proficiencies, etc.) and a list of **references** to the features it gains each level. For example, the **Fighter** class entry’s "classFeatures" might look like:

"classFeatures": \[  
  "Fighting Style|Fighter|PHB|1",  
  "Second Wind|Fighter|PHB|1",  
  {  
    "classFeature": "Martial Archetype|Fighter|PHB|3",  
    "gainSubclassFeature": true  
  },  
  "Extra Attack|Fighter|PHB|5",  
  ...  
\]

Each string like "Second Wind|Fighter|PHB|1" corresponds to a feature defined in the "classFeature" array (with matching name, class, source, and level)[\[24\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Class#:~:text=The%20basic%20identifier%20for%20class,level)[\[25\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Class#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20the%20artificer%20class%E2%80%99,levels%20are%20referenced%20as%20follows). The special object with "gainSubclassFeature": true marks the level (3 in this case) where the class gains a subclass; the classFeature value points to a placeholder feature “Martial Archetype” that essentially signifies “pick a subclass feature here”[\[26\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Class#:~:text=Features%20that%20indicate%20the%20class,instead%20indicated%20with%20an%20object). This referencing system means class features are defined once and can be reused or referenced across classes and sources. For example, if an upcoming *Player’s Handbook 2024* slightly tweaks an existing feature, it could reference the original feature with a new source tag or override it as needed, rather than duplicating large blocks of text.

**Level Progression and Tables:** Because class progression is encoded by listing features by level, it’s easy for the engine to determine what a class grants at each level (just filter the classFeature list by level \<= N). Additionally, the class entry often includes a textual “Class Table” as part of its description (embedded in the "entries"), and sometimes a machine-readable form of extra columns via "classTableGroups"[\[27\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Class#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Additional%20class)[\[28\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Class#:~:text=,%5D). For instance, the Wizard’s class data includes a table group titled “Spell Slots per Spell Level” with columns for 1st–9th level slots and 20 rows for each class level. These tables are primarily for display on the site, but they mirror the spell slot progression rules. Our rule engine might not need to ingest the entire table if we implement slot calculation logic, but it’s useful that 5etools provides the raw data (which could be parsed if needed). On the other hand, features like **Extra Attack** that scale (Fighter gets Extra Attack at level 5, and again via a feature at level 11, etc.) are each discrete entries in the classFeature list, which our engine can track as separate unlocks.

**Subclass Structure:** Subclasses are defined similarly. A class may have multiple subclasses across sources (e.g. PHB has Champion, Battlemaster for Fighter; later books add more). In 5etools, each subclass has its own entry with keys like className and classSource to link it to a base class[\[29\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Class#:~:text=%2A%20%60,which%20the%20feature%20is%20gained). Subclass features are in a separate "subclassFeature" list, each including className and also the subclassShortName and levels. The class’s main feature list (as shown above) will reference something like "Martial Archetype|Fighter|PHB|3" which tells the renderer “insert the subclass features here at level 3.” In practice, the site will then show the specific features of whatever subclass was chosen. For data usage, one can look up all subclassFeature entries matching the chosen subclass. This modular approach again prevents duplication – e.g. the **Eldritch Knight** subclass features are listed once under Fighter’s subclass list, even though they might appear in multiple sources (UA vs official). For our generator, we can load subclass definitions separately and attach them to classes, which is conceptually similar to how 5etools does it (class doesn’t own the text of subclass features, it just marks where they come into play).

**Ability Score Increases and Choices:** Races and feats in 5etools also use structured data to represent ability score bonuses and other choices, which is relevant for character generation. Races have an "ability" field which is an array of objects, each object representing a set of ability score increases[\[30\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Race#:~:text=%2A%20%60%22ability%22%60%20,For%20example). For example, a standard PHB race might have "ability": \[{ "str": 2, "con": 1 }\] meaning \+2 STR, \+1 CON[\[31\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Race#:~:text=,For%20example). If a race allows a choice (like “+2 STR/+1 CON **or** \+2 DEX/+1 WIS”), the data is represented as two objects in the array (one for each option)[\[32\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Race#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Different%20ability%20scores). Races introduced in Tasha’s Cauldron use a different format with a "choose" object (e.g. choose any 2 abilities to increase by 1\) – the schema supports that with choose.from, count, and amount fields[\[33\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Race#:~:text=,cha). This detailed encoding of ability score increases can directly inform a rule engine’s logic for applying racial bonuses or feat bonuses. Feats likewise can have an "ability" key if they grant a \+1 to an ability of the player’s choice (e.g. *Resilient* feat)[\[34\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Feat#:~:text=Feat%20,). By reading these fields, our character builder could present the user with the appropriate selection options.

**Proficiencies and Tags:** Classes and races list starting proficiencies, languages, etc., in their JSON. The class schema has startingProficiencies broken down by armor, weapons, tools, skills, each potentially with a choose mechanic for skills[\[35\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Class#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Starting%20proficiencies)[\[36\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Class#:~:text=Write%20the%20name%20of%20the,true). These are represented in simple arrays (e.g. "armor": \["light", "medium"\] for a class proficient in those armors) or objects if there’s custom text. Races often have similar fields for languages ("languageProficiencies" with choices or fixed languages)[\[37\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Race#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Language%20Proficiencies)[\[38\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Race#:~:text=To%20restrict%20it%20to%20certain,true). There are also boolean tags like a race’s "darkvision": 60 or a class feature’s "isSkillBonus": true used purely for filtering or highlighting. 5etools maintains comprehensive tag lists for filtering; for example, races have "traitTags" such as *Amphibious*, *Natural Armor*, *Spellcasting*, etc., which do not show in text but allow the UI to filter races by traits[\[39\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Race#:~:text=,only%20improves%20the%20filtering%20compatibility)[\[40\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Race#:~:text=,Skill%20Proficiency). In our engine, these tags could become useful metadata – e.g., marking a race as having *Darkvision* might let us automatically apply vision rules or simply help the user filter races by desired traits.

**Applying 5etools Patterns:** The separation of concerns observed in 5etools data is a best practice we can emulate. By keeping atomic data pieces (like features) separate and referencing them, we enable reuse and avoid inconsistencies. For example, a “Spellcasting” feature appears in every spellcasting class at level 1; 5etools writes it once per source and all classes reference it. We can do similarly (perhaps have a base implementation for 2024’s Spellcasting rules and have each class link to it). This also facilitates updates: if the Spellcasting rules change in 2024, one update to the feature text would propagate to all classes. The use of keys for references (like "Second Wind|Fighter|PHB|1") could translate to an internal ID system or simply a structured lookup in our TypeScript models. We might not use string keys in the frontend, but conceptually each feature can be identified by (name, class, level, source).

Additionally, the inclusion of progression data (like number of spells known, or cantrips known arrays) directly in the class definition is very useful for driving a character builder’s logic. Instead of hardcoding those progressions, we could parse them from the JSON and have the UI display how many spells a user can pick at a given level or auto-calculate it. This makes the system more data-driven and easier to update if WotC alters progression in the new edition.

## Items and Equipment Representation

**Mundane vs Magical Items:** 5etools splits items into mundane equipment (largely in the *PHB* and basic rules) and magical items (mostly in *DMG* and other supplements). The dataset groups “magic items” under DM content, separate from basic gear. In the file structure, it appears that mundane gear might reside in data/items.json (as the Markdown renderer’s example suggests)[\[41\]](https://github.com/QFrankQ/5etools-DnD-Rules-Markdown-Renderer/blob/bc2a490abdf80c509f42620ce1d471c5bd4d49b6/README.md#L176-L184), whereas magical items are likely in their own files by source (possibly under a top-level items/ directory for DMG, etc.). The exact split isn't explicitly documented in the snippet, but the **Item** data schema applies to both. Each item entry – whether a simple weapon or a legendary artifact – has a variety of fields describing its properties, many of which are geared toward enabling filtering and automated calculations.

**Common Item Fields:** Standard fields for items include: \- value: The cost in copper pieces (cp). All prices are normalized to cp for consistency (e.g., 5 gp is stored as 500 cp)[\[42\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Value). \- weight: Weight in pounds[\[43\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Weight) (with possible weightNote for things like containers being “full” or special cases[\[44\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=An%20item%20can%20also%20have,Will%20render%20as%20%E2%80%9Cx2%E2%80%9D)). \- category or type: A code that classifies the item broadly, used for filtering. For example, light armor vs heavy armor, simple vs martial weapon, potion, ring, etc. 5etools uses two-letter codes for this; a table in the item schema shows codes like "LA" \= Light Armor, "M" \= Melee Weapon, "S" \= Shield, "P" \= Potion, and so on[\[45\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Item%20Types)[\[46\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%60,Shield). These codes appear in the item’s "type" field. So a **Longsword** might have "type": "M", "weaponCategory": "martial" indicating a martial melee weapon[\[47\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Category). A **Healing Potion** might have "type": "P" and a rarity field. \- rarity: For magic items, a rarity string (Common, Uncommon, Rare, etc.) is given. This helps filter items by rarity in the UI. \- reqAttune: Attunement requirement. It can be true (attunement required by anyone) or a string condition (e.g. "reqAttune": "by a bard" for an item that only a bard can attune)[\[48\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Requires%20Attunement). If attunement is optional, they even use "optional" as value[\[49\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=). \- entries: Most items have an "entries" array for their description text (especially magic items, which often have lengthy descriptions). Mundane items might have very brief or no entries aside from properties.

**Weapons and Armor Specifics:** For weapons, fields exist to capture all relevant mechanics: \- Damage: dmg1 for base damage (e.g. "1d8"), dmg2 for versatile or secondary damage (e.g. "1d10" for a versatile longsword)[\[50\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Damage), and dmgType for damage type (using a one-letter code like "S" slashing, "B" bludgeoning, etc. – the schema provides a mapping of letters to full damage type names[\[51\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Damage%20Types)). \- Properties: Instead of a single text string of properties, 5etools encodes many as booleans or specific fields. For instance, a weapon with the Ammunition property will have "ammunition": true[\[52\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Weapon%20tags). If it’s a *loading* firearm, it might have a reload number of shots before reload[\[53\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Reload). Ranged weapons have a range like "80/320" in text form[\[54\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Range). Two-handed or light weapons are indicated by tags in an property array in some data (the wiki snippet doesn’t show the property array, but it is part of the schema – typically an item might have "property": \["2H","Heavy","Reach"\] etc., and those abbreviations are defined in a separate table). \- Weapon category: weaponCategory is explicitly stored as "simple" or "martial" (or "special") to separate those groups for filtering[\[47\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Category). There is also a notion of firearm tag in 5etools (for Renaissance or modern firearms from various sourcebooks) which might be a boolean or a category in their schema. \- For armor: There’s ac for base AC given by the armor[\[55\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Armor%20Class) (and acBonus or acSpecial for special formulas[\[56\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=)), stealth to indicate if it imposes stealth disadvantage (true/false flag)[\[57\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Stealth%20Disadvantage), and strength for the minimum Strength requirement (if any)[\[58\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Minimum%20Strength).

**Miscellaneous Gear and Other Items:** Adventuring gear, tools, mounts, vehicles are all represented in the item schema with various fields: \- Vehicles have extra fields like vehSpeed, vehAc, vehHp, vehDmgThresh for their stats, and capacity and cost fields for transport vehicles[\[59\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Speed%20,and%20AC)[\[60\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Costs). \- Items that serve as Spellcasting foci have a field scfType to indicate Arcane, Druidic, or Holy focus[\[61\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Spellcasting%20Focus%20Types), and a focus list if the focus is limited to certain classes (for example, an *Orb of the Mage* might have "focus": \["Wizard", "Warlock"\] if only those classes can use it as a focus[\[62\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=)). \- If an item grants a bonus to ability checks (like a *Headband of Intellect* sets INT to 19, or *Gloves of Thievery* give \+5 to sleight of hand), those are usually described in text, but certain standardized bonuses (like flat bonus to AC or saving throws) might be captured in a shorthand (e.g. magic armor could have "bonusAc": 1). The Homebrew Lexicon hints at fields like bonusAc or bonusWeapon etc., though not explicitly shown above[\[63\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/Lexicon#:~:text=The%20Ability%20Score%20to%20which,the%20AC%20for%20use).

All these fields make the data extremely rich. For our purposes, we can create TypeScript interfaces mirroring these properties so that we can easily use the 5etools data directly. The advantage of doing so is huge: we don’t need to manually type in equipment stats or worry about parsing freeform text to get, say, a weapon’s damage die – 5etools has already structured it for us. We can, for example, load all items and filter where type="LA" to get all light armors, then present their AC and weight to the user, or automatically calculate carrying weight, costs, etc., by reading the numeric fields.

**Filtering and UI for Items:** On 5etools, the Items page allows filtering by item type, rarity, attunement, source, etc. These are powered by the structured fields described. E.g., you can check a filter “Requires Attunement” and the UI will show only items where reqAttune is present; or filter by Magic vs Mundane by using the rarity field (all mundane items have no rarity or a blank rarity, whereas magic items have one of the defined rarities). Weapons can be filtered by properties (the site likely has checkboxes for “Finesse”, “Heavy”, “Thrown”, etc., which correspond to entries in the item’s property array). Since the data model cleanly separates these, implementing similar filters in React would be straightforward by querying those fields.

One particularly helpful practice is how 5etools uses codes and enums for many item attributes – it ensures consistency (e.g., always "S" for Slashing damage, always "martial" for weaponCategory, etc., avoiding typos). We should adopt similar enumerations in our data model or at least validate against them. They even list all possible item types and damage types in their schema documentation[\[45\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Item%20Types)[\[64\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Item#:~:text=%C2%B6%20Damage%20Types). We can directly use those lists to define TypeScript union types or enums for strong typing (for example: type WeaponDamageType \= "B"|"P"|"S"|...).

## Data Validation and Tooling in 5etools

5etools benefits from various tools and workflows that ensure data quality and assist with content management: \- **Schema Validation:** As mentioned, they maintain a JSON Schema for each data type (spells, items, etc., all built on a general “entry” schema). This schema is used with editors or test scripts to validate contributions. A contributor adding a new class or item must run a test (they have a test directory and scripts like validate\_subclassFeature.py) to ensure all required fields are present and all enums are valid. Adopting a similar approach, we could write JSON schema or TypeScript interfaces for our rule engine data and use them to validate any imported or edited content. \- **Homebrew Importer/Builder:** 5etools has a “Make Brew” and “Manage Brew” utility (visible in the menu) which allows users to input custom data in the same format. This means the system can ingest external JSON (same schema) at runtime. They even provide a Homebrew Builder GUI and a Text Converter to help format custom text into 5etools JSON[\[65\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/FromZeroToHero#:~:text=match%20at%20L237%20%C2%B6%20Quick,JSON%20Examples). For our project, while homebrew support might be beyond initial scope, structuring data and engine to handle dynamic injection of new JSON (e.g., a new subclass) could be worthwhile – 5etools demonstrates that if your data model is consistent, you can load new content on the fly and all filters and renderers continue to work. \- **Versioning and Source Control:** The data-centric approach means updates are simple: when a new sourcebook is released, the team adds a new JSON file (and updates index.json). The site can immediately load it. For our SRD tool, we’ll be more limited in scope, but if aiming to support the 2024 “One D\&D” content alongside 2014 content, a similar pattern of separate data sets or source flags will help. We might maintain a “SRD2024” source tag and allow the engine to switch modes or combine as needed. \- **Integration with VTTs:** The 5etools project also offers integrations like the Plutonium module for Foundry VTT and a Roll20 script (formerly betteR20). These work by mapping 5etools data into those platforms’ character sheet formats. For instance, Plutonium can import a full class or monster from 5etools JSON into Foundry’s data structure. The presence of fields like cantripProgression and spellsKnownProgression in 5etools class data[\[16\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Subclass#:~:text=,6%2C%207%2C%208%2C%209%2C%2010) was specifically added to facilitate *automation* in VTT character sheets. This forward-thinking design means our rule engine can directly benefit from the same data – effectively we have the progression charts programmatically accessible. Best practices we can take from this are: include any data that might be needed for automation or calculations, not just what’s needed to display text. The more we encode in structured form, the less we have to hardcode in logic.

* **Testing and Reliability:** The sheer size of 5etools (as noted \~106 MB of JSON data, 2804 entries were tested with 0 errors[\[66\]](https://github.com/QFrankQ/5etools-DnD-Rules-Markdown-Renderer/blob/bc2a490abdf80c509f42620ce1d471c5bd4d49b6/README.md#L220-L228)) shows that the format scales well. By using a mirror or subset of this data for SRD, we inherit a well-tested foundation. We should of course verify any assumptions for 2024 rules (some class structures might change), but the core format likely remains applicable.

## Applying 5etools Insights to Our Rule Engine

Finally, considering integration strategy: to build a flexible SRD-only rule engine and character builder, we can **reuse a large portion of 5etools’ data structures and even data content** (for the portions of SRD unchanged by 2024 rules). Specifically:

* **Reusable Data Components:** The **SRD content** in 5etools (races, classes, backgrounds, spells, items from the Basic Rules) can be extracted by filtering the JSON files for entries with source: "PHB" (for most player content) and source: "DMG" for a few things like basic magic items, plus any content tagged as srd:true. The parts of 5etools most directly reusable are the comprehensive lists of spells and items, along with their properties. These save us the effort of re-encoding spell details or item stats. We can load these JSON files into our TypeScript app (perhaps via a build step or an on-demand fetch if running in-browser) and then transform them into our application state. For example, we might parse each 5etools spell into a Spell class instance in our code. The mapping is straightforward because we can mirror the schema. Many fields in 5etools have direct analogues to what we need (casting time, range, components, etc.), and for new fields we want (like spell tags for filtering), 5etools often already has them (damage types, etc.).

* **TypeScript Model Mapping:** We should define TypeScript interfaces for each entity (Spell, Item, Class, ClassFeature, Race, Feat, Background, etc.) that include all relevant properties from the 5etools schema. For instance, a ClassFeature interface with name: string; className: string; level: number; entries: Entry\[\]; etc., matching the JSON[\[67\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Class#:~:text=Class%20features%20are%20defined%20with,the%20following%20properties). This ensures when we ingest the JSON, we get type-checked objects. The 5etools schema link provided[\[68\]](https://github.com/QFrankQ/5etools-DnD-Rules-Markdown-Renderer/blob/bc2a490abdf80c509f42620ce1d471c5bd4d49b6/README.md#L243-L250) can serve as a reference for building these interfaces. We should also incorporate their enums (like ability abbreviations, item type codes) as TypeScript type unions to maintain consistency with the data.

* **Rule Engine Logic:** With data in hand, we can build validation logic inspired by how 5etools structures choices. For example, to validate a character’s race ASI selection, we read the race’s "ability" array. If it contains a choose object[\[69\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Race#:~:text=,wis), our code knows to prompt the user to pick X abilities to increase by Y. This is far better than hardcoding specific race names and their rules. Similarly, to enforce that a level 1 Wizard can prepare INT mod \+ level spells, we know from the class that it’s a prepared caster (lack of spellsKnownProgression and presence of a Spellcasting feature entry that likely mentions preparation). We might not get the formula directly from data, but the data at least flags the class as needing preparation. In fact, an idea is to add a custom flag in our model like spellcastingType: "prepared" | "known" | "pact" per class. We can derive this by checking which progression array is present or even by source (Wizard, Cleric, etc., are prepared by 5e rules). 5etools’ **Renderer** doesn’t need this flag because it’s just displaying text, but our engine could benefit from a one-time mapping (e.g., set Wizard, Cleric \= prepared; Sorcerer, Bard \= known; Warlock \= pact; etc.). This is a minor augmentation on top of the imported data.

* **Translation Workflow:** In practical terms, an **import pipeline** might look like:

* Start with the official 5etools JSON files (perhaps a curated subset for SRD – the 5etools team might even provide an “SRD pack”). If not, use the filtering approach as above.

* Write a script or use a small program to read these JSON and prune any non-SRD entries. (For example, remove all spells with source \!= PHB except those also in the Basic Rules; remove classes like Artificer entirely if not in SRD, etc.)

* The output of that script could be a set of JSON files that only contain SRD content, but still in 5etools format. We could then directly load those into our app. This ensures we stay within legal content.

* Map the JSON to our internal classes. This may involve converting some structures: e.g., 5etools uses text strings for ability scores and saving throws (“dex”, “str”) – we might prefer an enum or a specific object. It also uses a lot of nested objects for choices, which we can keep as is or simplify once a choice is made (e.g., after a user picks their race’s ability increases, we don’t need to keep the whole choose structure around).

* Where 5etools data is very detailed for niche use-cases (like the Foundry active effect data in subclass features[\[70\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Subclass#:~:text=through%20the%20use%20of%20the,30%20feet%20of%20the%20user)[\[71\]](https://wiki.tercept.net/en/Homebrew/TableOfReference/Subclass#:~:text=,20)), we can decide if we need it. Likely we can ignore those parts (foundrySubclassFeature, etc.) as they pertain to automating VTT effects, not core rules logic.

* **Adapting to 2024 Changes:** The upcoming 2024 update to D\&D 5e (One D\&D) will introduce modifications (class feature tweaks, new subclass progressions, maybe different spell lists). Thanks to 5etools’ flexible schema, we can accommodate many changes by adding new sources. For example, if the 2024 *Player’s Handbook* revises the *Barbarian*, one could add a new JSON file for “Barbarian (2024)” with source “PHB2024” and include the revised class and features. The rule engine could then either replace the 2014 version or treat it as a variant depending on user selection. Because 5etools data model separates descriptive text from mechanics to a degree, and uses universal structures for things like “Extra Attack” (which is likely identical in 2024 anyway), we might reuse some features. But prudently, we might mirror what WotC does: e.g., *Expertise* might be a class feature now given to Bards and Rangers; rather than have two separate entries, 5etools would probably use one feature entry and list it under both classes. We should do the same, which again points to referencing by keys rather than duplicating content.

In conclusion, by leveraging 5etools’ data structures, we inherit a well-thought-out representation of D\&D 5e rules content. The key lessons to apply are: keep data and presentation separate, use structured fields (not just text blobs) for anything that might be used in logic or filtering, organize complex entities (like classes) into smaller components referenced by keys, and include metadata to differentiate sources or optional content. Using these patterns, our SRD-only rule engine will be easier to maintain and extend, and will readily support features like rule validation, character option filtering, and future content integration. The 5etools project demonstrates a robust blueprint for a D\&D compendium, and by adapting its JSON schema into modern TypeScript models and React components, we can rapidly develop a powerful character generator that stands on the shoulders of a proven system.
