Their mother kept a small, respectable bookshop; their father—absent more often than present—left behind only a name, a few coins, and rumors that he’d once served aboard a privateer that hunted sea-raiders and worse. Rook grew up devouring romances and travelogues alike, learning early that stories could make hunger feel smaller and loneliness feel temporary.\n\nAt the academy, Rook distinguished themself not through grim discipline but through obsession: marginalia filled with notes about “roc-songs,” flirtation rituals in old epics, and the recurring motif of a colossal bird carrying away a beloved. Professors called it fanciful; Rook called it a pattern. They became a sage by day and a performer by night, paying tuition with witty recitations and earnest serenades, collecting gossip from scholars and admirers with equal ease.\n\nThe turning point came when Rook uncovered a fragmentary account of a courtship between a sky-hunter and a mortal—half myth, half field report—written in the same hand as their mentor’s journal. The last line was a promise: a rendezvous at a cliffside ruin when the moon “wears a silver beak.” Rook left the academy with ink-stained fingers, a traveling tune on their lips, and the conviction that the world’s greatest romances are also its most dangerous mysteries.\n\nNow they wander from library to ballroom to wilderness outpost, following sightings of great wings and greater legends. Rook courts danger the way others court lovers: with a smile, a vow, and the stubborn belief that even a monster might be moved by the right words at the right moment.",

Their mother kept a small, respectable bookshop; their father—absent more often than present—left behind only a name, a few coins, and rumors that he’d once served aboard a privateer that hunted sea-raiders and worse. Rook grew up devouring romances and travelogues alike, learning early that stories could make hunger feel smaller and loneliness feel temporary.\n\nAt the academy, Rook distinguished themself not through grim discipline but through obsession: marginalia filled with notes about “roc-songs,” flirtation rituals in old epics, and the recurring motif of a colossal bird carrying away a beloved. Professors called it fanciful; Rook called it a pattern. They became a sage by day and a performer by night, paying tuition with witty recitations and earnest serenades, collecting gossip from scholars and admirers with equal ease.\n\nThe turning point came when Rook uncovered a fragmentary account of a courtship between a sky-hunter and a mortal—half myth, half field report—written in the same hand as their mentor’s journal. The last line was a promise: a rendezvous at a cliffside ruin when the moon “wears a silver beak.” Rook left the academy with ink-stained fingers, a traveling tune on their lips, and the conviction that the world’s greatest romances are also its most dangerous mysteries.\n\nNow they wander from library to ballroom to wilderness outpost, following sightings of great wings and greater legends. Rook courts danger the way others court lovers: with a smile, a vow, and the stubborn belief that even a monster might be moved by the right words at the right moment.",
                "appearance": "A lean, expressive human with wind-tousled dark hair and sharp, attentive eyes that seem to measure both posture and mood. Their style is tasteful but dramatic—clean lines, a hint of flourish, and small feather-like accents in pins or stitching that suggest an ongoing fascination with great birds. Their hands are ink-stained more often than not, and they carry themself like someone perpetually stepping onto an unseen stage.",
